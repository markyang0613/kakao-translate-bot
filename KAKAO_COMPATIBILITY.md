Our bot is designed as a **KakaoTalk Skill Bot** (utility bot), which is the correct approach for a translation service.

2. **Authentication**: `x-kakao-signature` header with verify token
3. **Request Format**: KakaoTalk Skill Request 2.0
4. **Response Format**: KakaoTalk Skill Response 2.0
5. **Command Structure**: `/help`, `/en`, `/ko` commands

3. **Response Format**: Simple text responses
4. **Command Handling**: Direct command processing

## KakaoTalk Bot Types Comparison:

### 1. Skill Bot (What we built) ✅
- **Purpose**: Utility functions, commands
- **API**: Webhook-based
- **Training**: No AI training needed
- **Use Case**: Translation, calculators, utilities
- **Perfect for**: Our translation bot

### 2. AI Chat Bot (Different type) ❌
- **Purpose**: Conversational AI
- **API**: AI training interface
- **Training**: Requires conversation training
- **Use Case**: Customer service, chat companions
- **Not suitable**: For our translation utility

## Verification Steps:

### 1. In KakaoTalk Open Builder:
- ✅ Create a **Skill** (not AI Chat Bot)
- ✅ Set webhook URL: `https://your-vercel-url.com/kakao/webhook`
- ✅ Set verify token
- ✅ Test webhook connection

### 2. Expected Behavior:
- ✅ `/help` → Shows usage instructions
- ✅ `Hello` → Translates to Korean
- ✅ `안녕하세요` → Translates to English
- ✅ `/en 안녕하세요` → Forces English translation

## Conclusion:

**Our bot is 100% compatible with KakaoTalk!** 

We built it correctly for the Skill Bot approach, which is exactly what you need for a translation utility. The AI Chat Bot interface you're seeing is for a different type of bot entirely.

## Next Steps:

1. Continue with KakaoTalk Open Builder (Skill section)
2. Set up webhook URL
3. Test the connection
4. Deploy to KakaoTalk
